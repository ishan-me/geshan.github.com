Getting a super scalable working URL for your application take hours if not days. Setting up something like Kubernetes is a huge task. This is where Google Cloud Run shines, you can get a working HTTPs URL for any of your containerized app in minutes.Google Cloud Run is serverless and fully managed by Google, you get super scale, billing by the second, HTTPs URL, and your own domain mapping. If you want to run stateless containers Cloud run is hands down the easiest way to do it. In this post, I will detail how to get your Laravel 6 app working on Google cloud run with Continuous Integration (CI).Prerequisites #You are familiar with PHP/Composer and aware of Laravel (if you&#39;ve landed here you are I suppose)You know how to use Git from the CLIYour code is hosted on GitHub for CI/CD and you are familiar with GitHubKnow a fair bit of docker, maybe even multi-stage buildHave a working Google cloud account (they give you $300 credit free for 1 yr, no reasons not to have an account)Why is Cloud Run a great option for beginners #For two reasons as mentioned belowLearn about the best practices and software like docker and CI/CDGetting the basics going is click a button, select 2 things wait for 5 mins you get a working HTTPs URL. Can it be any easier than this :)Steps to deploy #Below are the steps to set up and deploy Laravel 6 on Cloud Run:1. Clone Laravel or new Laravel project #Start by cloning Laravel or using composer or the Laravel CLI as indicated in the official installation guide. I am using composer to get the latest Laravel as below:Command #I ran the following command to get the latest laravel:composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel6-on-google-cloud-run2. Test it locally first #Then run  some code  in the repoThen it pushed the built image to Google Container RegistryAfter that using the gcloud CLI it deployed the built image to Cloud Run, which gave back the URL.10. Hurray, your app is working #After you hit the URL you should see your app working on Google Cloud Run like below:If you want to deploy another version you can merge your PR to master and click the button again to deploy.More about Google Cloud Run #The pricing for Google Cloud Run is very generous. You can run any containerized app or web app on Google Cloud Run. I ran a pet project that got ~ 1 request per minute and I did not have to pay anything.Behind the scenes, it is using Knative and Kubernetes. It can also be run on your Kubernetes cluster but who would choose to manage a K8s cluster if you can just push and get a scalable serverless fully managed app :).TLDR #To run Laravel 6 on Google Cloud Run quickly follow the steps below:Make sure you are logged into your Google Cloud AccountGo to https://github.com/geshan/laravel6-on-google-cloud-runClick the &amp;quot;Run On Google Cloud&amp;quot; blue buttonSelect your projectSelect your regionWait and get the URL of your Laravel App as below, Enjoy!Conclusion #There you go running a Laravel app on Google cloud run was pretty easy. You have even got tests running on Github with Github actions. Hope it helps. To do a CI/CD approach you can check this post, it shows deployment using Cloud build. As the same container is running for local and production (Google Cloud Run) environments you don&#39;t need to learn a new framework to go Serverless. You can try Symfony too on Google Cloud Run.Any containerized web app can be run on Google Cloud Run, it is a great service.", "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Geshan Manandhar"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization",	"name": "Geshan Manandhar","logo": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://geshan.com.np/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png"}},"mainEntityOfPage": { "@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://geshan.com.np/blog/2019/10/get-laravel-6-running-on-google-cloud-run-step-by-step-with-ci/"}}</script><article class="hentry"><header class="page-header"><h1 class="entry-title">Set up Laravel 6 on Google Cloud Run step by step with Continuous Integration (CI)</h1><p class="meta text-muted"><time datetime="2019-10-21" data-updated="true"><time class="entry-date" datetime="2019-10-21"><span class="date"><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" title="Posted at"></i> 21-Oct-2019 </span></time></time>| (about a 10 minute <i class="fas fa-glasses" title="read"></i>)</p></header><div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Laravel has <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2014-10-22%202019-10-21&amp;q=laravel,symfony">soared</a> in popularity in the last few years.

You have even got tests running on Github with Github actions. Hope it helps. To do a CI/CD approach you can check this <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/simplifying-continuous-deployment-to-cloud-run-with-cloud-build-including-custom-domain-setup-ssl-22d23bed5cd6">post</a>, it shows deployment using Cloud build. As the same container is running for local and production (Google Cloud Run) environments you don't need to learn a new framework to go Serverless.
